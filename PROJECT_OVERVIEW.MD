Technical Assessment: AI-Assisted System Design &

Implementation

Objective
This exercise evaluates how you think, how you communicate intent, and how you leverage modern AI
coding tools.
We are deliberately not testing your ability to write code line by line.
You are expected to use an AI coding agent of your choice to generate most or all of the
implementation.
The primary focus of evaluation is how you prompt, guide, and correct the AI, not the final code output
itself.

The Task
Design and implement a small but complete software system of your own choosing.
The system must meet the following criteria:
• Solves a real problem, even if small or hypothetical
• Has a clear purpose and user or consumer
• Includes at least one meaningful architectural decision
• Has both functional and non-functional considerations
Examples (non-exhaustive):
• A lightweight API for managing a resource (tasks, inventory, bookings, events)
• A background job or event-driven processor
• A simple service that integrates with a third-party API
• A small frontend + backend interaction
• A data ingestion and transformation pipeline
We would like to see the code in PHP (Laravel), React, C# or a combination of the above.

Mandatory Requirement: AI Coding Agent Usage
You must use an AI coding agent to generate the code.
Examples include:
• ChatGPT
• GitHub Copilot
• Cursor
• Claude
• Any comparable AI-assisted coding tool
Manual coding is allowed only for:
Minor fixes
Glue code
Configuration
Clarifying intent when the AI output is incorrect
If the AI writes poor code, that is acceptable. What matters is how you steer it.

Deliverables
Submit the following:
1. Prompt Log (Primary Deliverable)
Provide a chronological log of the prompts you used with the AI agent.
For each prompt, include:
The exact prompt text
The reason you wrote it that way
What you expected the AI to do
What it did well or poorly
Any follow-up or corrective prompt you used
This can be a markdown document, text file, or PDF.
2. System Overview
A short write-up covering:
What the system does
Why you chose this problem
Key architectural decisions
Trade-offs you consciously made
Keep this concise. One to two pages is sufficient.
3. Code Repository
The code does not need to be production-ready.
Clarity of intent matters more than polish.

Constraints
Timebox yourself to 3 to 4 hours
Do not over-engineer
Avoid premature optimization
Focus on decision-making, not completeness
Provide the generated code and documentation in a public Git repository and send me the link to it.

Evaluation Criteria
We will assess your submission based on:
1. Prompt Quality
Clarity
Specificity
Structure
Awareness of AI limitations
2. Iterative Guidance
How you refine prompts
How you recover from poor AI output
How you correct assumptions
3. Systems Thinking
Ability to decompose a problem
Awareness of trade-offs
Practical architectural judgment
4. Communication
How well you explain intent
How readable and reasoned your prompt log is
5. Code (Secondary)
Coherence
Alignment with described intent
Reasonable structure

What This Test Is Not
A trick question
A speed-typing contest
A test of obscure language features
A test of AI prompt gimmicks
We are interested in how you think with tools, not how you compete against them.

Final Note
In real work, engineers increasingly collaborate with AI systems.
This exercise reflects how we expect modern developers to operate:
clear intent, good judgment, and effective use of leverage.
